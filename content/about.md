In my previous life I aspired to be a concert pianist. I played lots of piano and traveled a bit. Hear me play a [Beethoven Trio](https://youtu.be/psRoQK_j0pY), [Copland](https://youtu.be/T8n5tYnc5sY), and a [Liszt Concerto](https://youtu.be/LePrhMvuE1k).

I have 3 degrees, a bachelor's of Music in Piano Performance, a Master's degree in Piano Performance and Pedagogy, and finally a 2^nd^ bachelor's in Computer Science (Spring 2018). I am *done* with school, but not done learning. :wink:

My major school projects were building a compiler and writing a [Lemming's Clone for the browser](://github.com/pianomanfrazier/lemmings-clone).

Currently I work on a fairly mature Java web application with Ext JS on the front end. I am leading the effort to rewrite portions of the front end in Vue.js and Vuetify to work with mobile devices. My preferred programming language is Python with Flask as my web back end framework. I am happiest when I am creating, building, solving problems, and have some autonomy.
