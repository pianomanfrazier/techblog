{{< profile src="/img/profile.png" alt="Ryan Profile Picture" >}}

In my previous life I aspired to be a concert pianist. I played lots of piano and traveled a bit. Hear me play a [Beethoven Trio](https://youtu.be/psRoQK_j0pY), [Copland](https://youtu.be/T8n5tYnc5sY), and a [Liszt Concerto](https://youtu.be/LePrhMvuE1k).

I have 3 degrees, a bachelor's of Music in Piano Performance, a Master's degree in Piano Performance and Pedagogy, and finally a 2^nd^ bachelor's in Computer Science (Spring 2018). I am *done* with school, but not done learning. :wink:

My major school projects were building a compiler and writing a [Lemming's Clone for the browser](https://github.com/pianomanfrazier/lemmings-clone).

Currently I work on a fairly mature Java web application with Ext JS on the front end. I am leading the effort to rewrite portions of the front end in Vue.js and Vuetify to work on mobile devices.

My new favorite thing is Elm and functional programming. I am in the middle of writing a learning platform for music theory in Elm. The app is like Khan Academy and Duo Lingo but for music theory. It will be epic.
