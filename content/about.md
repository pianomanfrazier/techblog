### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my previous life I aspired to be a concert pianist. I played lots of piano and traveled a bit. Hear me play a [Beethoven Trio](https://youtu.be/psRoQK_j0pY), [Copland](https://youtu.be/T8n5tYnc5sY), and a [Liszt Concerto](https://youtu.be/LePrhMvuE1k).

I have 3 degrees, a bachelor's of Music in Piano Performance, a Master's degree in Piano Performance and Pedagogy, and finally a 2nd bachelor's in Computer Science (Spring 2018). I am done with school, but not done learning. ðŸ˜‰

- I'm currently learning GoLang
- Learning to speak Portuguese, fluent in Mandarin Chinese
- Ask me about fermenting jalapeÃ±os
- I love to hike the mountains of Northern Utah
- I'm currently reading *Crime and Punishment* by Fyodor Dostoevsky 

### My Writing

In my [Elm Calculator Book](https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/elm-calculator-book/01-intro/) I walk through building a calculator using the Elm programming language.
