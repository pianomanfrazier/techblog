This is a test of KaTex and MMark.

There are some big problems with MMark.

- references don't work correctly at all. The hash goes to root of site. Not relative to page. Should get current path of page and inject in reference.
- nested figures
- Figure: caption for code blocks

## KaTex Test {#header}

$$\pi_3 = \int_{0}^{\infty}$$

Some inline math $$x = \sum_{0}^{10}{\left( \frac{12}{\sqrt{z}}x^2 \right)}$$. Isn't it great.

{callout="#"}
~~~python
from math import * #<1>

print(pi * sin(2)) #<2>
~~~

Here are some callouts to code <1>. And here is spot <2>.

Some text goes here. I am writing some example text.

Here is a table:

{#table-caption}
Name    | Age

Bob     | 27
Charlie | 4
Alice   | 23


{#mytable}
Name    | Age
--------|-----:
Bob     | 27
Charlie | 4
Alice   | 23

See my beautiful table^[<https://google.com>]. Don't use citations.
