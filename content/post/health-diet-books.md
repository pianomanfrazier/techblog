If you are going to have a conversation about diet and health at least do your research. After experiencing some health problems and frustrations with the U.S. medical system I checked out dozens of books from the library and read at least a dozen.

## Changing your diet

Making lasting change to your diet takes time. If you make drastric radical changes to your diet you will have a hard time keeping it up. I have noticed that I go in spurts. I make some drastic changes for 3-4 weeks. I discover I really like how my body feels on the change and so I keep with the change. When my wife and I decided to stop drinking milk we drank absolutely no milk or at any dairy for 1-2 months. My wife lost 10-15 pounds from this change. Now milk is a treat. We both grew up drinking a glass or two of milk at every meal thinking it was good for you. Now we drink it rarely as a treat with cookies about once a month. We also do not give milk to our kids. Milk is actually a poor source of calcium.
