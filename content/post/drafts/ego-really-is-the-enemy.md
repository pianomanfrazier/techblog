I have been reading through Ryan Holiday's "Ego is the Enemy". He makes some strong points that I mostly agree with.

When writing software you must detach your value as a person from your code. I think I got used to doing this when studying music.

You go into every lesson willing to accept that anything could be improved or made better. Your craft is much more valuable than your attached ego to it.

Your work exists outside of you. It can become greater than you if you let it go. The work does not define you. If it sucks, own it and make it better.

If I code review your work and it's garbage, don't take it personal. I write garbage too. Please tell me. I will gladly throw it away and do it better.

If you make a mistake when performing you cannot afford to dwell on the mistake and criticize yourself. It only makes things worse. Just fully accept the mistake and move on. It's a live performance and mistakes just happen.

Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink. Taking ownership and responsibility takes humility and guts. Own it to change it. Own it and realize that you have some power to change things and make it better.

## Don't Be Passionate

"Follow your dream," they say. "Become so good at your passion that people will pay you for it." That only works if your passion and something useful to the world intersect. Some people make it work. If you passion is serving others and creating the most value for others people will pay you for it.

If you passion is Renaissance Lute Music good luck making enough money to live on. Fight the system or work the system. I have not regretted switching careers away from music. Starving is not fun. Living gig to gig is exhausting. Since there is no money in music, musicians fight over the scraps. "If I succeed, you fail" is the mindset. I found the culture so toxic. I am glad I left.

I would often get a new college piano student. In their first lesson I had to point out that basic things like rhythm were wrong. They were often crushed. They had been told their whole lives they were good at it. I don't know if they are good or bad. They just missed the rhythm. Stop attaching a label to it. It doesn't mean you don't have talent or you can't be good at it later. It just means you played it wrong and we can fix it together. Piano lessons are not for patting you on the back telling you how good you are. Don't you expect me to tell you how to do better? If I knew better and didn't tell you, you should fire me.

What is the purpose of code reviews? Make better code. Insult the person who wrote it. Make the reviewer look better?

Why do code reviews?

## The Talent Myth

It's a lot easier to believe there is this magic thing called talent. You are born with it or you are not. If you don't have it, don't bother trying and working so hard because you will never get there.

If you are talented, then anything that convinces you otherwise will be crushing. You will have an identity crisis. If you are defined by your talent, then when it is gone what is left. Do you even have value in society? What defines who you are?

> Passion typically masks a weakness.
> Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance.
Quote: -- Ryan Holiday, *Ego is the Enemy*  page 8

### Belief #1: I am talented

Everything needs to be an affirmation that you are talented. Your talent defines you. Anything that questions this is an affront to you identity.

### Belief #2: I am **not** talented

Why try at all because you were not born with it.

### What to believe instead

Just do the task at hand. Set goals and do better. Your past successes and failures do not have to define what you will do in the future.

You can learn from you past successes and failures.

There are no failures, only information.

Of course, all failures are not created equally. If you fail and die then you don't get the play again. Someone else might benefit from your failure though.

The best failures are the ones we can learn from and recover.

We need an environment where we can experience **low risk failures**.

Researchers tell us that the best way to memorize something is to recall it as early as possible.[^makeitstick] Even if we fail. When we know exactly the parts we do not know.

[^makeitstick]: *Make It Stick*

## Failure is the master teacher

When you know you have failed then you can fix it.

Failure can be a great teacher if you let it. If you fail and then don't do anything you have learned nothing.

My 5 year old son was playing the old Zelda SNES game for the first time. He was getting frustrated because he kept dying. The next time he died my wife said, "That was a great failure. Can you do it again?" Now that he saw failure as a good thing, it didn't paralyze him. He could move forward and learn from it.


My mantra

> As far as I've come, I have that much further to go 

It's like the reverse of Zeno's Paradox. Close the distance by half, then the distance increases two fold. This is what learning looks like. We because increasingly more aware of how much we do not know.

> The trouble with the world is that that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.
Quote: -- Bertrand Russell


## Self Talk

You have limited brain juice. Spend it wisely.

### "I am so awesome"

You stop thinking about the task at hand and you are thinking about how everyone around you perceives you. It is often that I get through a hard part in a piano performance and then I think, "everyone thinks I am so awesome." I then mess up. It takes valuable brain juice to think that. You then aren't focused on actually performing the task.

> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.
>
Quote: -- KJV Luke 18:19

He had raised the dead to life, caused the blind to see and he says he is no good. All the glory to God.


### "I suck"

You get caught in a cycle of self defeat. We believe the stories we tell ourselves. If we continually say, "I am bad at math." You will find all the reasons to confirm your suspicions. You'll do all this work and then get confused.

"See, I told you I was bad at math."

This only wastes brain juice. You only have so much. Why spend it on beating yourself up.

> Confusion is a sign that you are learning

When you overcome the confusion you have actually learned something. If you are never confused then you are not learning.
