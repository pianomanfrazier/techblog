Premise: We all want the best environment for our children to be healthy and grow to be successful adults. We all sit through a 2 hour meeting on a Friday morning to make our school a better place. We want to minimize risk while maximizing growth and potential.

Upon reflection of Friday's community council meeting, I have been concerned by the mode of communication and understanding among the members of the council during the public comment section. Such lack of listening, understanding, and empathy is what leads to so called "unreconcilable differences" that destroy marriages, families and communities.

The council members seemed to have a complete lack of empathy that my family and I contracted COVID under school masking and COVID policies. My daughter felt ill and tired, so she stayed home from school one day. She felt much better the next day and tried to go back to school the next day but we were informed by the school that she had been in contact with another student who had contracted COVID. A few days later I contracted COVID and missed 3 days of work and worked somewhat shorter days for the next week because I was unusually tired.

My kids have also brought home 2 colds and a nasty flu from school. The flu happened 2 weeks ago.

I brought up my viewpoint prepared to endure criticism and lack of understanding from other community members. I hesitated to even speak up. Shutting down viewpoints that differ from your own do not make the viewpoint disappear. You run the risk of not hearing viewpoints that differ from your own in the future. Do we want a commitee where the only viewpoints voiced are those with the loudest voices? There was no respect for diversity of opinion.

Starting a conversation with the viewpoint "the science is obviously clear," allows no room for discussion. Any conclusion that differs is thrown out as heretical, uneducated, and delegated to the flat-earth conspiracy theorists. Such a position that ones viewpoint is absolutely correct is arrogant. Healthy relationships are based on mutual respect and understanding.

I am far more concerned about the mode of communication that occured in the meeting than who is right and wrong.

I voiced my concerns about the previous policy and clearly nobody listened. So if you are interested, I voice my objections to the previous mask policy here. I seek not to change anyone's mind, just to voice my conclusions after much research and observation. I have had many such conversations with those that agree and disagree with myself. I read every update and change in recommendations from the CDC weekly. I get a weekly newsletter from the COVID response team at my workplace, the Space Dynamics Lab.

My wife and I were among the first parents that I know that pulled their kids out of school when the pandemic hit. We pulled our kids out of school a week before the state officially closed schools. There were so many unknowns at that time. A year and a half later we have a lot more information.

I also draw on the experience and expertise of my mother who is a nurse at the Idaho Falls hospital. Her main duties this last year was to work the COVID wing of the hospital. I know this is one data point, but it does inform my perceptions.

My concerns are the following.

1. Masks must be worn properly, must fit well, must be made of effective materials to effectively stop the spread of disease. I have observed even the most ardent of mask wearing parent's small children at church and school have difficulty finding a well fitted mask and wearing that mask over their nose. These children touch their faces far more than if they weren't wearing a mask. To my knowledge, mask effectiveness has not been studied in small children (8 and younger, so most of the gradeschool). The CDC recommends age 2 and older. Have you tried to get a 4 year old to wear a mask properly? At best they provide minimal protection, at worse they increase the likelyhood of infection.

This is especially true of the youngest at our school, preschool and kindergarten. Even among adults, I have had a conversation with a mask wearing ER doctor, who touched and fiddled with her mask dozens of times during the conversation. If a trained medical professional has difficulty following good mask hygeine, then how do we expect children to do better? My mom has observed the same thing at the hospital where she works. Mask wearing is more complicate than if they work or not, but do our behaviors and habits allow for their effective use as a policy?

2. Lunchtime policy at our school undermines any protection the child may have had throughout the day. Per CDC guidance, unmasked individuals should sit in a six foot radius social distance. I know this is difficult and perhaps infeasible at school. Weigh the risks and benefits and make decisions accordingly. It is most likely that my daughter caught COVID while at lunch.

Here are some other thoughts based on the concerted effort of the community council to educate me.

Children do not seem to contract and spread the virus as easily as older people. Children contracting and dieing of the virus is more unlikely still. The child is probably more likely to be hit at the cross walk on their way to school than die from COVID. Children suffering complicatations to the virus have one or more serious medical conditions (severe asthma, heart conditions, diabetes...), as a parent you have the freedom to weigh the risks and act accordingly, but as a general policy this does not include most children.

If your objection is that we need to protect parents and elderly, we now have the vaccine. If we can't aggree that the vaccine works, I'm not sure at what point we can proceed. The push for further masking and behavior change despite vaccine availability is furthing the vaccine hesitancy. Why get the vaccine if nothing will change? The message is you can still spread COVID and you can still get COVID.

For someone so cautious about the long term consequences of contracting COVID, you are very willing to accept a vaccine that has only been in use for a year. I have every indication to believe it is safe. Don't misjudge me by thinking I believe the vaccine to be a part of a large global depopulation strategy. However, every vaccination has its risks and unintended side effects.

If we live our lives guarding against all the possible things that could go wrong in the universe, we would get nothing done. There are always trade offs. We all do risk benefit analysis and live our lives accordingly.

If you have been vaccinated, contracting the disease is highly unlikely. So even if others are not wearing masks they provide no real threat to the vaccinated.

The CDC does not recommend small children under 12 years old get the vaccine (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/adolescents.html). By suggesting child vaccination either you distrust the CDC because you interpret that to mean they don't have enough vaccines, like they lied about masks at the beginning because they feared not having enough masks, or you think contrary to the CDC that children should be vaccinated.

Some of the most disadvantaged in our school systems will suffer the most from masks. Those with hearing disabilities who depend on reading lips. Those with speach impediments (I have a daughter with diagnosed speach and socialization issues and I don't think masks and/or zoom class are helping). So if we are going to make policy based on a couple outliers who will suffer, don't these student matter too? Again, trade offs.

There is a field of scientific inquiry about the communication done with the human face. See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006557

Teachers wearing masks is not just a minor annoyance, there is a field of science studying the human face. How we communicate with the face. The subtle responses in physiology to facial expressions. Facial communication is a part of human evolution and biology. Again, the trade off between less effective communication (probably even more true among foreign language learners) and COVID safety. The blind often have trouble learning to speak because they cannot see the face? Mask wearing might have similar impacts, more data and information needed. What are the long term impacts of wearing masks all the time for adults who interact with children?

If we make policy based on this trade off, others will be more willing to go along with it if at least you acknowledge the trade off instead of treating them as ignorant uncompassionate monsters.

Babies stress response to facial expressions.

40+- muscles in the human face. Communicate through the face. Hide half the face confuses children. Teachers and children have to speak louder to hear each other.

Human faces are the most varied part of our body compared to the rest of the animal kingdom.

To say the science is clear, is to mean that there is a subset of all the science available that agrees with a particular conclusion. Science is vast and solutions to problems have many variables and many trade offs.
