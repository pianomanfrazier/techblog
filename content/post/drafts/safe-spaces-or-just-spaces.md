A safe space is a by product of a just space. Who determines what is safe? Is it the rules and laws or the mob?

The safe space mentality also goes along with the "guilty until proven innocent."

Guilty until innocent is the weakest and easiest policy. Just assume any accusation is true and then try the guilty as if they are innocent. If the courts don't agree then we get a mob together and enforce it.

If the courts and due process are broken then lets fix them. We should not be enforcing this by mob rule and anarchy.

Case 1: My child is accused of beating a kid up at recess. Get's a lecture about consequences even though he maintains his innocence. The accuser is not in the room.

Case 2: My daughter is accused of logging into another student's account. She loses a week of recess. She maintained her innocence and the teachers were too busy to respond to our emails and phone calls.

Case 3: Man in my community is accused of raping a woman 20 years ago. The woman comes forth now and wants due cause. The statute of limitations is past. Why not seek due course at the time of the crime? Do we ruin this man? He has lost his job. We need law and order. Can we accuse others without recourse of the consequences. They are then guilty until proven innocent.
