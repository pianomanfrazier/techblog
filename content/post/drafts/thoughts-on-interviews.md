The last few weeks we have interviewed 5 candidates to replace a developer that is leaving our team. Here are a couple of thoughts from participating in that process. As a pianist I learned a lot from watching competitions and judging competitions myself.

As an undergraduate music student I wanted to win the annual concerto competition. Winners of the competition got the opportunity to play a concerto with the university orchestra. It took me 3 years until I won the first time. The thing that made the difference was that after I had performed I watched every other contestant. It was a game to me. The questions I wanted to answer were: What set the winners apart from the others? What type of pieces did they play? How did the judges respond to their playing?

After watching the competition for several years I noticed that only certain composers and types of pieces got chosen by this particular faculty. Winning had as much to do with convincing the jury as it did with playing well. There were some contestants who played well but were never chosen. It is a game and to win you have to figure out the rules.

Later I have been invited to judge several competitions and usually the winners stick out due to their stage presence, difficulty of piece, and the overall stage effect of the performance.

Going through this process for the first time for me has helped me see the priorities of those hiring and what they value. The hiring commitee was very reserved about hiring a candidate that has excellent technical skills but appeared to be difficult to work with. The candidate had by far the best technical knowledge and experience but appeared to hold fast opinions that would make it hard to work with in a team. Maybe that wasn't the case but that was the impression from the interview.
