## Why Study Music?

merge mind, body, real time performance
demands focus
play with your brain not your fingers
opportunity to teach others
structure and form
started studying with Gary Amano in high school. Very generous. Studied with him for 10 years.

## Why Switch?

I worked in New Jersey/New York City and at Heifetz with musicians from Baltimore area. I also worked locally freelance for musical pits, opera accompanists.

Felt my work was interchangable.

The community is competitive and do not build each other up. Software if you help and support each other the product is better. I like working with others.

## Lifestyle

I wanted a large family. I do not prefer living in the city. I love mountains. Very few jobs. Didn't feel I was creating much value in society as a musician.

I can get a job in any decent sized city. I could even work remote and live anywhere with an internet connection. I get to see other people using my work. It has value.

I completed most of the pre-med course work. I struggle with medical care in the U.S.

It's not about money. I need enough.

I hate long commutes. Spend your life in a car.

The industry is so large/so much work to do that you can find a culture that resonates with your world-view.

## How I started with programming

Build piano website with Wordpress and Joomla (never made sense and wanted to fully understand it)
Paid designers, I wanted to design my own stuff
My father in software (very supportive)
never programmed before 2013, started with Python (that's what MIT started with)
Python the Hard Way
Flask Mega tutorial (did freelance for Dentist, made several static blogs)

Secret wish to study more math. Finish calculus series and take other maths. I graduated with a Math minor.

## How they are similar

There is always something new to do. Someway to do your craft better. A practitioner of the craft. Like Tai-Chi, running, ... The culture in software is what I hoped music would be.
