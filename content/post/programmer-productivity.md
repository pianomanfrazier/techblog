Some thoughts on being more productive.

- Get some good noise cancelling headphones. I got some Bose QC35 II and I love them. They block out all chit chat at the office. If someone wants to interupt me they have to make an effort.
- Turn off notifications on your phone and computer apps. Every little interuption breaks flow. Be mindful about when you check your email and texts. Most things are not urgent. If it's urgent they can call you or leave a message. If it is urgent in the office they can come talk to you in person.
- Listen to nature sounds or other white noise. As a musician I find music to be hard to concentrate to. I usually play something like [this](https://youtu.be/ja8pA2B0RR4).
- Make a plan everyday before you start work what you plan on accomplishing. Make sure you stay on task and take notes on your progress. I really like checklists.
- I keep a little notebook. I write the date down and make a checklist of things I need to get done that day. It also makes it easier to send my boss a weekly report if I can look back over my day by day notes. Before I adopted this practice I would get to the end of the week and wonder what I had actually accomplished. I thought I worked hard but couldn't remember what I had done. This has been especially important as we are trying to meet deadlines and I can show my boss that I am getting stuff done and that things just take time. I am working as fast and efficiently as I can.
- Finish one task before starting another one.
- Get a good nights sleep. I am not productive if I am tired. I try to get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep.
- Don't wake up 10 minutes before you leave to work. Wake up early, exercise, meditate, or write in your journal. Your most productive hours are in the morning. Get the day started off right.
- Try an extended fast. It's good for the mind and the body. See Dr. Fung's excellent book [The Complete Guide to Fasting](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Fasting-Intermittent-Alternate-Day/dp/1628600012).[^1]
- Take care of yourself. Eat good food. Get enough sleep. Have good relationships. If you are sick you are not working.
- Have purpose. Why are you going to work everyday? Do you find meaning in what you are doing?
- If you get stuck on a problem leave the office and go for a walk. I often come to a solution after a short walk. It is much better than trying to force your way through a problem.
- Every few hours get up and move. Go for a walk. Get a drink of water. Pounding the computer for hours on end is draining mentally and physically.
- Get to the office an hour or two before everyone else does. These quiet undisturbed hours are my most productive.
- Focus takes practice. Focusing on a single task for an hour or two can be mentally draining.
- The goal is to reach a state of flow.


[^1] I do a monthly 2-3 day fast for religious and health reasons. Once I got used to it, I look forward to the monthly fast. After the first day you don't really get any hungrier. In fact by the end of day 2 I am usually not hungry at all but have a lot of energy and mental clarity.
