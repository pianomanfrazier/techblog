Here is a simple app I wrote to play around with Elm. I augmented the form tutorial from the [Elm Docs](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html). The source can be found [here](https://github.com/pianomanfrazier/CS4700_language_evaluation/blob/master/form.elm).

The exercises in the tutorial were to augment the form in the following ways:

- Check that the password is longer than 8 characters.
- Make sure the password contains upper case, lower case, and numeric characters.
- Add an additional field for age and check that it is a number.
- Add a "Submit" button. Only show errors after it has been pressed.
