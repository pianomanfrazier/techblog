# Pianomanfrazier.github.io Source

The site is generated with Hugo

`deploy.sh` is a helper script that cleans out the old files from `pianomanfrazier.github.io`, builds and pushes the new site the live repository.

It's a little *hacky* but it gets the job done.

Since recent versions of Hugo have broken my theme. I am sticking with Hugo v0.46 for now. Just grab that version of the binary and use that.
